Suicides and Homicides Analysis using R, Python

The Data has been analyzed on mental health of suicides and homicides in different countries. 
The visual graphs are represented by combining the web scrapped Homicides data and Suicide data along with Mental health survey. 
Data interrogations in between these three dataset are showing the age groups of the crimes and they seek help before the incident
or had treatment. I have designed this application with help of R studio and Python.
